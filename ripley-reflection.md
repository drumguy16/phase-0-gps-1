#Guided Pairing session 1 Reflection

*What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

	Prior to this session I felt pretty confident with my git workflow thus far.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

	This session our guide shed some light on some helpful shortcuts to make our git workflow more efficient. I had no clue that git had such a handy tab comlete shortcut. Now I don't have to type out the name of every file or folder I want to navigate to like a doofus. Also, if we want to stage all of our changes for commit at the same time, we can use the command: git add .   Pretty handy.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

	I mainly asked questions about speeding up workflow and efficiency in git and the command line. I was having trouble opening Sublime Text from my command line so my guide gave me a fix for it.

*What still confuses you about git?

	I feel very confident with everything that we have covered about git so far.

*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

	My first guided pairing experience was great!!
